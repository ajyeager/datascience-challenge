# Interview Challenge Problem

**Dataset**: [https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset)


## The Challenge
This challenge makes use of a set of ~6M Yelp Reviews containing star ratings, text, and the relevant business.

### Task 1

Given the textual content from a review, build a classifier to predict the star rating.

### Task 2

The 100 most-frequent businesses have over 1000 unique reviews, some many more.  Build a model that when given a set of 1, 5, or 10 reviews from the same property predicts which of the 100 properties they belong to.

## Success Metrics
We realize these (particularly task 2), are difficult problems.  Additionally, we have not used this dataset before and aren't sure what a good baseline result would be.  However, as defining metrics and putting performance statistics in context is part of a data scientist's job, we'll leave it up to you to summarize your findings and convince us of your model's strengths and weaknesses.

## Deliverables
- Code / notebooks representing the work done to train and evaluate the models
- Research Notebook (Logs)
	- Progress reports
	- Thoughts on the problem
	- Experiments and takeaways from them
	- etc...
- Summary Document Containing:
	- Explanation of the project - definition, metrics, results
	- Explanation of the final approach taken
	- Reasoning behind the recommended approach
	- Next steps

## Logistics

 - Please use Python - but make use of any libraries you like
 - You can use additional datasets if you like
